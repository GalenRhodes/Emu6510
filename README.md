# Emu6510

Emu6510 is an experimental emulator for the 6510 family of microprocessors found in computers
such as the CommodoreÂ® 64.

## Goals

The project will be developed in four phases:

1) ~~Documented opcode emulation - no undocumented opcodes.~~ - _Done_.
2) ~~Frequency emulation - throttling down to 1-2 Mhz.~~ - _Done_.
3) ~~Exact cycle support.  In other words if an instruction took 7 clock
cycles on a 6510 then it will take 7 clock cycles in the emulator as well.~~ - _Done_.
4) Undocumented opcodes.
