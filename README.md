# Emu6510

Emu6510 is an experimental emulator for the 6510 family of microprocessors found in computers
such as the Commodore速 64.

## Goals

The project will be developed in four phases:

1) ~~Documented opcode emulation - no undocumented opcodes.~~ - _Done_.
2) ~~Frequency emulation - throttling down to 1-2 Mhz.~~ - _Done_.
3) ~~Exact cycle support.  In other words if an instruction took 7 clock
cycles on a 6510 then it will take 7 clock cycles in the emulator as well.~~ - _Done_.
4) ~~Undocumented opcodes.~~ - *Done.*

Currently, the only thing supported is the emulation of the processor itself.  The further emulation of an entire machine, such as, say, a Commodore速 64, is still remaining to be done.  This may take a while.

The first goal of this project is to emulate a Commodore速 1541/1571/1581 disk drive on an [ODROID速 H2](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-h2plus/).
